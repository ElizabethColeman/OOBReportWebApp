OOBReportWebApp
===============

The Out of Bed (OOB) web application will be used by Ms around the world to make the submission of OOB reports easier and faster for M. OOB reports are filled out when a M is traveling and staying overnight outside his or her assigned location. These reports were previously built in a text template in an email, sent to a generic email address, and forwarded on to the necessary reciever. These reports are used to track the Mâ€™s location, with whom they will be in contact, transportation information, and lodging information. This application will streamline the filing process and make the reports easier to fill out.
